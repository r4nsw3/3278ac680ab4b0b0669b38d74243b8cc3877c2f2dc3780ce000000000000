  |   Nineteen years after the events of Wolfenstein II, BJ Blazckowicz     |
  |   has disappeared after a mission into Nazi-occupied Paris. Now,        |
  |   after years of training from their battle-hardened father, BJ's       |
  |   twin daughters, Jess and Soph Blazkowicz, are forced into action.     |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Wolfenstein: Youngblood features the most open-ended Wolfenstein      |
  |   experience to date. From a new base of operations located deep in     |
  |   the heart of the Paris catacombs, plan how and when to attack and     |
  |   dismantle the Nazi regime.                                            |

  |   As part of the update, a new Treasure Hunt sidequest has been         |
  |   added. There are also new abilities, Pep Signals, and skins to        |
  |   access.                                                               |

  |   * TREASURE HUNT MISSIONS & MAPS.                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Studying the artifacts from Lab X revealed the location of a second   |
  |   Da'at Yichud chamber inside a reservoir underneath Little Berlin.     |
  |   Apparently, the Nazis found a sealed chest there that supposedly      |
  |   contains an item related to the God Key. So far, they have been       |
  |   unsuccessful in their attempts to open it up. Maybe you'll have       |
  |   more luck...                                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   After completing the endgame side mission, "Da'at Yichud              |
  |   Artifacts", you'll have access to a new sidequest called "Treasure    |
  |   Hunt", which will take you through two completely new areas - a       |
  |   Parisian reservoir and a secret Nazi bunker - in order to unlock      |
  |   the Da'at Yichud chest. You'll contend with three new enemy types -   |
  |   the Wurmlochsoldat (Teleporting Ãœbersoldier), the Electrodrohne       |
  |   (Tesla Drone) and the Turmhund (Laserhund with a turret) - in these   |
  |   locations.                                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Once you've finished the "Treasure Hunt" mission your journal will    |
  |   be updated with a list of 20 Treasure Maps in the "Missions" tab      |
  |   that will lead you to artifacts scattered around Paris. Each          |
  |   artifact you track down will reward you with XP, Silver Coins and     |
  |   one Ability Point.                                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * NEW ABILITIES & PEP SIGNALS.                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   All three of your ability trees - Mind, Muscle and Power - receive    |
  |   new abilities as part of Update 1.0.7. New abilities like Quick       |
  |   Revive (Mind), Dual Wield Expert (Muscle) and Silent Killer           |
  |   (Power). One of your other new Power abilities is the God Key Sense   |
  |   ability, which you'll need to help you locate treasures in the        |
  |   world. This ability is automatically granted upon completing the      |
  |   "Da'at Yichud Artifacts" mission, so you won't have to spend          |
  |   Ability Points to get it.                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In addition to these new abilities, you'll be able to take            |
  |   advantage of two other (id Software title-inspired) Pep Signals.      |
  |   Hammer Rage restores Heavy Weapon ammo for you and your partner,      |
  |   while Quad Damage does exactly what it says on the tin - you and      |
  |   your sister will deal quad damage for four seconds.                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * NEW SKINS.                                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Update 1.0.7 also comes with a slew of new skins like the Bomber      |
  |   skin, the Chrome Syndrome skin and the Bloodthirst skin for you to    |
  |   wear into battle.                                                     |
